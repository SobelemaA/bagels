In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues.
The game offeres one of the following hints in response to your guess:
  - 'Pico' when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place
  - 'Fermi' when you guess has a correct digit in the correct place
  - 'Bagels' if your guess has no correct digits

*You have 10 tries to guess the secret number*
